What is regex?
A regular expression, or regex, in general, is a pattern of text you define that a Linux program like sed or awk uses to filter text or any software that supports regex usage.

We saw some of those patterns when introducing basic Linux commands and saw how the ls command uses wildcard characters to filter output.

Types of Regex

There are many different applications that use different types of regex in Linux, like the regex included in programming languages (Java, Perl, Python, etc.) and Linux programs like (sed, awk, grep) and many other applications.

A regex pattern uses a regular expression engine which translates those patterns.
